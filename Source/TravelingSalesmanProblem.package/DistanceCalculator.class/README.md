==================
  This routine calculates the distance between two points (given the     
  latitude/longitude of those points). It is being used to calculate     
  the distance between two locations using GeoDataSource (TM) prodducts

    South latitudes are negative, east longitudes are positive

    lat1, lon1 = Latitude and Longitude of point 1 (in decimal degrees)  
    lat2, lon2 = Latitude and Longitude of point 2 (in decimal degrees)  
    unit = the unit you desire for results                               
           where: 'M' is statute miles (default)                         
                  'K' is kilometers                                      
                  'N' is nautical miles
